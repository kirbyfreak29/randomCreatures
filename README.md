# randomCreatures
A food chain simulation with randomly generated creatures.

The food chain simulation will model creatures who feed on and are fed on by each other.
There is no built in food chain, but creatures instead will make decisions on what to eat based
on their traits and the traits of creatures nearby. Creatures will also breed and die over time.  
The creatures will eventually have randomly generated attributes, with possibilities to mutate over time,
but those won't be implemented until the basic systems are working correctly. The user interface is a graphical
interface, with the ability to highlight a specific creature and follow it and see itâ€™s attributes.
