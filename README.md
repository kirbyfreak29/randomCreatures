# randomCreatures
A food chain simulation with randomly generated creatures.

The food chain simulation will model creatures who feed on and are fed on by each other.
In its most basic form, the simulation will use concrete numbers of creatures, and changes
in population of a certain creature will affect the populations of creatures on the food chains
above and below it.  Creatures will also breed and die in time.  The creatures will eventually
have randomly generated attributes, with possibilities to mutate over time, but that might not
be within the scope of this class’s project.  The user interface will hopefully be a graphical
interface, with the ability to highlight a specific creature and follow it and see it’s
attributes, but will start out as a terminal program.
